# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rake db:seed (or created alongside the db with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
sudhakar = User.create!([{ name: 'sudhakar', email: 'sudhakar@gmail.com', password: 'test123', password_confirmation: 'test123' }])
#   Mayor.create(name: 'Emanuel', city: cities.first)
